        MY LEARNING PLAN FOR BECOMING A WEB DEVELOPER
      </h2>
      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
      </h3>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        Next is to define a reasonable period of time to work on the problem
        independently through research, course notes, discord, and other
        resources etc. If I am unable to progress, and the task isn’t urgent,
        I’ll switch to working on something else unrelated or take a short break
        away from work and return to the problem refreshed for another attempt.
        At this point if I have been unsuccessful I will reach out to my course
        facilitator or home group and ask for help.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        My expectation is that during any meetings or review sessions with my
        facilitator, they're as honest as they can possibly be with any feedback
        regarding how I'm tracking during this course. Although I will be
        committed to working on and improving my learning plan as much as
        possible myself. I hope that my facilitator will bring up any concerns,
        suggestions, or advice as they become aware of my learning style.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things
      </h3>
      <p>
        Currently I have no extracurricular obligations. However it is important
        for me to formulate a learning plan that allows for time to add
        non-course related hobbie/activities either in the evenings or on the
        weekends. I have just moved to a new location in the country so
        naturally this is a component of my learning plan that will evolve as I
        progress through the course.
