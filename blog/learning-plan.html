        MY LEARNING PLAN FOR BECOMING A WEB DEVELOPER
      </h2>
      <h3>My Learning Plan for Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        Having completed foundations I am now excited to enter Bootcamp and
        apply and build on my skill set in a classroom based setting.<br /><br />
        Revisiting my long term vision as a web developer I identified that the
        most important component of this goal for me, is to be using my skills
        to contribute to something that will ultimately add value to the lives
        of others.<br /><br />
        A strength I can bring to Bootcamp is my ability to empathize and relate
        to a broad range of people. I think this will help productively during
        peer coding sessions and group projects. I also think it will be
        valuable for enhancing my social experience during Bootcamp and
        ultimately create friendships within my cohort. I also have discovered
        that naturally I bring a growth mindset to my learning that will help
        maximize my learning experience across all aspects of Bootcamp.<br /><br />
        Foundations has highlighted that I need to work on knowing when I should
        ask for help. I feel Bootcamp will provide a good opportunity for me to
        work on this limitation as I think being in a live classroom setting
        will encourage me to reach out for help more frequently. The biggest non
        technical challenge for me is going to be adhering to my Te Whare Tapa
        Whā wellbeing plan. I have noticed when I become overwhelmed and
        stressed, I have a tendency to neglect self care, highlighting the need
        for increased discipline in consistently prioritizing and allocating
        time for.<br /><br />
        During Bootcamp I would like to see myself improve on my reflective
        skills. I would like to work on my ability to reflect without requiring
        prompts from external sources. While I have enjoyed this aspect of
        foundations, I would like to develop a more independent ability to
        reflect on my learning journey.<br /><br />
        I aim to create a more precise day to day structure that establishes how
        I will use my time outside of scheduled class time to ensure optimal
        productivity and well being. This plan will allocate specific time slots
        for focused studying, practicing exercises, and collaborating with my
        peers, while also incorporating breaks for exercise, relaxation, and
        reflection to help maintain a healthy mindset. I will find time at the
        end of each day to revise and make any necessary changes for the
        following day.

      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        A long term goal of mine is to one day be working on healthcare systems
        here in Aotearoa/New Zealand. This would be a meaningful opportunity for
        me to contribute to an industry that would benefit from innovative
        change, and could directly improve the lives of others. I want to build
        on my skill set not only as a developer but as a designer too. Although
        my primary goal is to become a full stack web developer, I would like to
        supplement this skill-set with an education in user experience design. I
        think having an understanding of both fields will strongly enhance my
        versatility and adaptability within a software development team.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        My analytical approach to independent learning allows me to break down
        large complex concepts into smaller more digestible sections to help
        understand and retain abstract material. Another strength of mine is
        persistence. I don’t easily give up. The less I understand something the
        more drive I have to gain a comprehensive understanding of it. In group
        learning environments I think my biggest strength is being able to
        empathize well with others. This will help me form good relationships,
        and communicate effectively with my peers.
        <br />
        <br />
        A limitation I encounter often is identifying when I have spent too much
        time trying to solve or understand something. I easily lose track of
        time when persisting and can easily abandon any learning strategy or
        plan I have in place. Knowing my limits and asking for external help
        sooner is definitely something I need to work on and hope to improve
        during this course.

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to work on utilizing the expertise of my peers more
        frequently to ask for critique and feedback on my work. I often wait
        until I have completed a task before sharing it and I think I would
        benefit a lot from seeking input from others more regularly throughout
        my work flow.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
      </h3>
      <p>
        - At the beginning of each week I will outline the overall objectives
        that need completing by the end of the week. I will then break these
        down into smaller daily goals with specified time frames.<br /><br />-
        At the end of each day I will dedicate time to reflect and assess
        whether I have achieved my goals for the day. During this time I can
        make any adjustments to my learning plan for the rest of the week if
        necessary.<br /><br />- Currently I am using the pomodoro technique for
        time management and have been starting and finishing each day at
        consistent times.<br /><br />- I will include time within my daily
        schedule to allow for breaks away from studying. If I feel that stress
        is building and I am struggling to keep on top of my workload I will be
        proactive at getting in touch with my facilitator before it becomes
        unmanageable.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        My current strategy for overcoming any learning barriers I encounter is
        to first establish the root cause of the issue. Next is to define a
        reasonable period of time to work on the problem independently through
        research, course notes, discord, and other resources etc. If I am unable
        to progress, and the task isn’t urgent, I’ll switch to working on
        something else unrelated or take a short break away from work and return
        to the problem refreshed, ready for another attempt. At this point if I
        have been unsuccessful I will reach out to my course facilitator or home
        group and ask for help.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        My expectation is that during any meetings or review sessions with my
        facilitator, they're as honest as they can possibly be with any feedback
        regarding how I'm tracking during this course. Although I will be
        committed to working on and improving my learning plan as much as
        possible myself, I hope that my facilitator will bring up any concerns,
        suggestions, or advice as they become aware of my learning style.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things
      </h3>
      <p>
        Currently I have no extracurricular obligations. However it is important
        for me to formulate a learning plan that allows for time to add
        non-course related hobbie/activities either in the evenings or on the
        weekends. I have just moved to a new location in the country so
        naturally this is a component of my learning plan that will evolve as I
        progress through the course.
