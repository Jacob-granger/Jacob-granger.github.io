      <h3>
        How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity teaches us that our
        brain has the capacity to change and grow. In short, it explains how our
        brain can continuously change and reorganize itself throughout our life,
        in response to internal and external stimulation. It is important to
        note that our brain has this ability regardless of our age and
        challenges traditional beliefs that our brains become fixed and
        unchangeable past a certain age. By understanding the principles of
        neuroplasticity we can make significant improvements in learning,
        rehabilitation, mental health and personal growth.

      <h3>
        How can I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Having an understanding of neuroplasticity motivates me to consistently
        build and work on areas of my life in which I perceive myself as average
        or lacking confidence. It has taught me that not only can I keep
        improving on the skills I already have, but I can also acquire entirely
        new skills no matter my age. I am excited to apply this knowledge to
        both my studies and relationships, in pursuit of personal growth and
        meaningful connections with others.

      <h3>What are some ways for me to increase my neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        An important way for me to increase neuroplasticity currently is through
        practicing and learning new skills. This can help stimulate the
        formation of new neural pathways and also strengthen existing ones.
        Additionally, I would like to increase neuroplasticity through
        practicing mindfulness and meditation. Studies show that this can help
        increase attention, reduce stress and ultimately will facilitate my
        ability to apply myself to learning more effectively.

      <h3>What is Growth Mindest and why is it relevant?</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity and “Growth Mindset” go hand in hand. Neuroplactity
        explains the science behind how our brains can adapt and change, whereas
        a growth mindset is more of a belief system that supports the idea that
        our capabilities, both intellectually and physically, are not fixed
        traits and rather they can be worked on and improved. A person who has
        adopted a growth mindset is aware that they can develop and improve not
        only from effort and practice, but also from embracing challenges and
        seeing them as opportunities rather than setbacks. Ultimately having a
        growth mindset promotes a love of learning, no matter the trials and
        tribulations we encounter along the way.

      <h3>
        How I plan to integrate my understanding of neuroplasticity and growth
        mindset into my learning plan
      </h3>
      <p>
        Having an awareness that my brain has the capacity to restructure,
        create, and strengthen neural pathways highly motivates me to lean into
        aspects of this course that I find challenging. It’s encouraging to know
        that these challenges aren’t permanent roadblocks and instead of
        avoiding them, I can use them as a training ground for reprogramming my
        brain to ultimately overcome them. It will help me engage with content
        that I find difficult to understand and will help prevent me from
        feeling discouraged when I’m not learning as fast as I hope to be.
