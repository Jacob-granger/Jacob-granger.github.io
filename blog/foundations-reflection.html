      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the first thing I have learnt about myself is related to my
        willingness to ask for help. This has been a quality of mine that I have
        worked on in the past and have made a lot of progress with in certain
        environments (previous jobs etc). However I haven't studied for a long
        time and reflecting on this quality recently whilst studying again, has
        revealed I need to work on asking for help more frequently within a
        learning based environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can be reluctant to put my work out for others to review when I feel
        like it isn't in a complete state that’s up to my own personal
        standards. This is definitely an ego thing and when I think about it I
        haven't been in many situations where I have had to share work of mine
        that's in a WIP state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the principles of growth mindset has taught me alot about
        my approach to learning. An aspect that I found really interesting was
        considering that we can adopt different mindsets based on different
        contexts/environments we can find ourselves in. It’s made me really
        think about different situations and the type of mindset I bring to each
        of them and that it's important to work in them individually rather than
        all together at once.

      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        When learning, having a clear understanding of what our core values are
        will ultimately provide the foundations for our goals and objectives,
        and provide direction for what we aim to achieve during our learning
        journey. When programming they can act as a guide for ethical and
        responsible development practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Empathy is essential for being able to understand how we connect with
        others within our learning environment. Having empathy for the people
        around us can enrich our learning experience for ourselves and for
        others, fostering a healthy learning environment. When programming,
        having empathy can allow us to work more effectively within development
        teams and can facilitate a more user-centered approach to programming.
        This can result in building more meaningful systems that end users are
        more likely to adopt and use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having self awareness when learning allows us to understand our
        strengths and weaknesses. With this awareness we can apply our strengths
        more effectively and identify areas that require improvement. When
        programming, having self awareness can help us understand our skill
        level, areas of expertise and limitations. It can help with setting
        realistic goals and provide us with valuable insight as to when we need
        to ask for help and utilize the expertise of others to improve
        productivity within a team.

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        What surprised me was realizing how little time I spend trying to
        improve my “human” skills. It has made me realize that if I want to
        improve these skills I need to dedicate time and effort to practice the
        same way I do with technical skills.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I found it challenging to apply and practise these skills throughout
        foundations as there was an overwhelming amount of content introduced
        all at once. However, I think entering bootcamp will provide me with
        more opportunities to practice and develop these new skills I have
        learnt.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Having previously studied a degree in IT I felt there was a lack of
        teaching surrounding “soft skills” that are essential within the
        industry. EDA has recognised the importance of equipping graduates with
        a strong skill set in both “soft” and “hard” skills, if they are to hit
        the ground running as a web developer and excel within their roles. At
        the end of the day most of the roles we find ourselves in require
        working with people. Our actions affect others (outputs) and others
        actions affect ourselves (inputs). Learning how to manage these inputs
        and outputs is essential for succeeding within the IT industry.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Definitely not! On the whole I have found the core learning material
        insightful and valuable and I look forward to applying these new skills
        in a team based scenario and independently. Like with getting better at
        any technical skill we can only develop and improve our human skills
        through expanding our understanding and practicing.
