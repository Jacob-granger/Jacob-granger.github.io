      <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
      <p>
        A time where I was blocked on a simple problem was when I was trying to
        define a function that took a string/sentence as an input, removed any
        presence of a specific word regardless of whether it contained capitals
        or not, then returned a new string without the word/words in the
        sentence.<br /><br />
        I immediately had an idea/direction for how to write the code needed to
        execute this task and began using pseudocode to map out the steps in
        plain English that I would need to complete the function. However as I
        began writing code to execute each step I had outlined I began to
        discover that a method I was using wasn’t returning the appropriate
        values I needed for solving the problem. I returned to my pseudocode and
        began to brainstorm how I could change or add steps to my code before
        and after the method was called to try and enable the use of it. I quite
        quickly realized that my solution was becoming messy and complicated and
        still wasn’t solving the problem.<br /><br />
        At this stage I chose to ignore the pseudocode I had written and instead
        used the rubber ducky method to explain outloud exactly what I was
        trying to accomplish each step of the way. Quickly this revealed that
        the fundamental problem wasn’t with how I was using the method but
        rather I had chosen the wrong method to begin with. After becoming aware
        of this I went back to the drawing board and realized there was a more
        appropriate method I could use, which in turn solved the problem
        completely.<br /><br />
        This process was fun but a little frustrating as here I was certain I
        had chosen the right direction for solving the problem but it turns out
        I was on the wrong path right from the beginning. It taught me that it’s
        easy to become tunnel visioned on a problem and it’s important to return
        back to the drawing board sometimes and look at the problem with a fresh
        perspective.

      <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem:</h3>
      <p>
        A time I felt that I elegantly solved a problem was during a challenge
        called fizzbuzz. The aim is to create a function that takes a number and
        returns different results based on whether the number is a multiple of
        15, 5, 3, or none of the above.<br /><br />
        Approaching this challenge it was obvious there were multiple solutions
        to solving the problem. Usually I would begin coding without a plan and
        just adjust and change my code as I go. This usually results in a messy
        solution and I can become a bit lost within my code and can struggle to
        troubleshoot it, if it doesn't execute the way I expect it to. Instead I
        employed the use of pseudocode once again to plan and map out the
        control flow of this function. This allowed me to have a clear vision of
        what I was trying to achieve and allowed me to gain a solid overview,
        before coding, of how I could make it cleaner, more scalable, and adhere
        to DRY (do not repeat yourself) concepts.<br /><br />
        Ultimately this was a very satisfying process as once I began writing
        code, I had more intention behind what I was writing rather than just
        guessing and checking along the way and produced a more elegant result
        versus if I had gone ahead without using any problem solving techniques.

      <h3>
        My experience with different problem solving techniques/processes:
      </h3>
      <p>
        PSEUDOCODE:<br />I love using pseudocode, more me it addresses the issue
        of where to start. I like to use it as a plan to map out a set of
        instructions that I can follow to write the code for the problem I am
        trying to solve. I also feel that it quickly reveals if I have chosen
        the right path to follow in order to solve the problem, and can be
        quickly changed and edited if needed at little cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        TRYING SOMETHING:<br />If I am completely stuck on where to start with a
        problem, just “trying something” can be an effective way to begin
        approaching and begin solving it. There’s nothing to lose from just
        trying. At the end of the day it presents you with some direction as to
        how to move forward. It essentially gives me two answers: “that didn't
        work” or “that did work”, which is something tangible to work with
        rather than just staring at a blank screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        RUBBER DUCKY METHOD:<br />I like the rubber ducky method, I like to use
        it to reveal sections of my code that are likely the root cause of my
        problem. If explaining something out loud doesn't make sense then it’s
        likely the code I have written to execute that statement doesn't make
        sense either.
      </p>
      <p>
        READING ERROR MESSAGES:<br />Reading error messages is something I'm not
        super confident with. This is due to not having a great understanding of
        the syntax and how to interpret them entirely. This problem solving
        technique is something I want to gain more confidence with and I think
        will naturally occur as I gain more experience as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        CONSOLE.LOGGING:<br />Using console.log() is an effective way for me to
        keep track of data types that are being returned from methods and being
        passed on to functions. I find it is really useful for helping me
        understand whether I have been using the right methods and functions.
        And can quickly reveal why my code is returning unexpected results.
      </p>
      <p>
        GOOGLING:<br />Googling is hit-and-miss for me. One thing I need to get
        better at is filtering through results to obtain the information that is
        relevant to my problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASKING PEERS & COACHES FOR HELP:<br />I'm getting better at this,
        naturally I do enjoy the problem solving process however, I need to
        learn how to limit the amount of time I spend doing this independently
        and instead ask for help from my peers and coaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        IMPROVING PROCESS WITH RELFECTION:<br />Although I enjoy reflecting at
        the end of completing a challenge/milestone, something I need to get
        better at is revisiting my reflections when I encounter new challenges
        or become stuck on new problems to remind myself of what previously
        worked and didn’t work. This would help me become more efficient at
        solving problems and could help prevent me from repeating mistakes I
        have made in the past.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help:</h3>
      <p>
        I encountered a moment where I was reluctant to ask for help during a
        challenge where I was struggling to assign a function type value to an
        object's property key within a loop. I wasn’t gaining much success and
        began with using console.log to understand what wasn't working then
        progressed to using google to look for help as I still wasn’t gaining
        any progress. I think I became reluctant to ask for help as I viewed it
        as a simple problem and because I had invested so much time into trying
        to understand it, my ego came into play and wanted to credit itself with
        figuring it out. However upon reflection this is exactly the time where
        I should have asked for help, as it was clear that my own problem
        solving tactics weren’t helping and instead, asking for help from my
        peers or coaches, would have been more productive.
