      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now
      </h3>
      <p>
        An interesting situation that would arise during my role as production
        manager in my last job, was when a colleague would make an error within
        their role which subsequently would cause major irreversible issues
        further down the production life cycle. As production manager my
        employer would consult with me to understand what went wrong and
        essentially look to discover who made the error and why, in order to
        prevent the issue from recurring. In a particular incident my employer
        confronted me about an error that had caused major issues. During this
        encounter they had already decided who they thought was responsible and
        put the blame on them and left it to me to resolve the issue. However,
        in this situation I realized it was me who was responsible for making
        the error. I could have easily said nothing and allowed someone else to
        take the blame. Instead I made the ethical decision to tell my boss that
        it was me who had messed up relieving the blame from my colleague.<br /><br />
        Although I would consider this example to be a minor ethical decision. I
        believe it is an example that helps me understand some of my values and
        reinforces who I am as a person. Looking at the different outcomes based
        on my decision the consequences are very minor. However, often it’s the
        smaller decisions with minor outcomes where people decide to forgo their
        moral principles as it’s easy to think “well it doesn’t really matter
        nothing bad will come of this”. Being honest and having compassion for
        others are core values of mine. During this situation I could have
        abused my position of responsibility and let someone else take the blame
        who didn't have the chance to stand up for themselves. Reflecting on
        this occasion reinforces to me that compassion for others and honesty
        are values that I strongly adhere to regardless of the situation. Of
        course, although not easy at the time, I still believe that this was the
        right decision to make. I think having empathy for others and remaining
        as honest as you possibly can in all situations promotes trust, and is
        essential for forming healthy relationships with others.

      <h3>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The biggest influence on who I am today has come from my parents and my
        upbringing. Although there wasn’t a strong sense of tradition within our
        household growing up there was a large presence of core family values
        that we all share and I still value immensely today. Having grown up on
        an off-grid lifestyle block I have always had a strong connection to
        nature and an understanding of the importance of sustainable living. One
        of the values that this lifestyle helped shape in me is how to be self-
        sufficient. It has taught me to adapt quickly in challenging
        environments and to take responsibility to initiate change, rather than
        relying on external help to make it happen for me. The other value this
        upbringing has taught me is contentment. This lifestyle has helped shape
        the concept of not wanting more than I need. Living a more simplistic
        life has taught me to identify and value what’s essential in my life
        rather than seeking happiness through what I don’t have.

        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey
      </h3>
      <p>
        A quality of mine that I’m most proud of are my interpersonal skills.
        Being able to empathize and communicate easily with a broad range of
        people has helped me thrive in team environments, manage conflict, and
        build good meaningful relationships amongst friends and co-workers.
        Listening, understanding, and being patient with people will allow me to
        learn from others around me and foster good communication and
        collaboration amongst my peers.

      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of my limitations is seeking help. Often, when completing a task if
        I get to a point that is difficult I can find it challenging to admit to
        myself that I need external help. This has been a moderately consistent
        barrier in my past. Ultimately this could affect my career development
        journey by leading me to become unnecessarily stressed and stuck during
        tasks, which would prevent me from moving forward quickly. This in turn
        would also affect team members/ co-workers etc.<br /><br />
        Another limitation to my learning and career development has been
        procrastination. This involves starting and completing tasks. This means
        I can feel disappointed in the quality of work I have produced. I would
        say this has been an ongoing, minor obstacle throughout my learning
        journey. Becoming aware of this limitation, and identifying strategies
        to improve this has been a major focus of mine. I think as I progress
        through my learning journey and gain more experience and opportunities
        to deal with this barrier, it will become less and less of a limitation.

      <h3>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why
      </h3>
      <p>
        An example that first comes to mind was when I worked in a group with
        two other members. During team meetings there was often conflict between
        the other two as they knew each other well outside of the team. I
        struggled to weigh in on the decision making and express my view point
        as it felt like I was choosing a side when I expressed my opinion.<br /><br />
        Initially with these meetings I would stay silent when conflict between
        them arose. By not contributing it made the meetings unproductive and
        made my presence feel redundant. To try and facilitate productivity, I
        decided that in the end I had to push aside the fear of how my opinion
        would affect their egos and focus on what the objective of the meetings
        were. Rather than force my view into the mix of already conflicted
        opinions, I would first discuss each option by considering the pros and
        cons of each of their suggestions and I would keep a strong focus on the
        problem at hand. This would help neutralize the conflict as it would
        divert the discussion away from “who is right and who is wrong,” and
        back to the main objective, allowing me to voice my own opinion on the
        matter without feeling like I was picking a side.<br /><br />If I were
        in this situation again I think my strategy would be to let them know
        how their conflict affected my contribution at group meetings. This may
        have given them the opportunity to gain awareness of the situation, and
        aim to change, in order to make the meetings more productive.
