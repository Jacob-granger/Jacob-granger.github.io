      <h3>What is JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s pretend a website is a car. HTML forms the structure of the car
        and can be represented as the body and chassis defining where all
        elements of a car are positioned such as wheels, doors, windows, brakes,
        seats, steering wheel etc. Now let’s add CSS to the car. CSS simply
        makes the car look cool, it adds paint color, rims, tinted windows,
        fluffy seat covers etc attributes that makes the car unique and
        desirable for people to buy. At this point we can tell there’s a car in
        front of us and we like the look of it, but when we hop in the driver's
        seat and turn the key nothing happens! The car isn’t responsive yet. To
        do this we need to add JavaScript! Adding JavaScript adds parts to our
        car such as an engine, sensors and electrical components that allow us
        to operate and use the car for its intended purpose.

      <h3>Control flow and loops, what does this mean?</h3>
      <p>
        Pretend you’re lighting a fire. To build a successful fire you need to
        follow a set of steps in a specific order to achieve this. For example:
        Make tinder bed, place kindling on top, light match, stoke fire. This
        order of actions we need to take to light a fire is called the control
        flow. In developer terms the control flow is the order in which a
        computer executes statements of code in a file. The default control flow
        in computing is to execute lines of code from top to bottom. Therefore
        we need to make sure the order is correct because if the wrong line of
        code is executed before another, our code will crash - the same way if
        we light the match before we gather anything to burn there will be no
        fire! Take a look at the code example below.
      </p>
      <img src="images/control-flow-1.png" />
      <p>
        Sometimes we need to make different decisions based on specific
        conditions before progressing to the next step. For example when adding
        a piece of wood to our fire we need to check if it is dry or wet.
        Depending on which condition is met a different action is required
        before proceeding. In computing we can use control statements to direct
        the control flow. In this instance we would use a conditional statement
        which can be used to execute a different line of code if a condition is
        met. Check out the code snippet below.
      </p>
      <img src="images/control-flow-2.png" />
      <p>
        Using an "if" and "else" statement this fuction first checks if the wood
        is dry. If yes? Then add wood to the fire. If the wood isn't dry it
        doesnt add to the fire an instead moves to the next line and checks to
        see if the wood is wet. If the wood is wet it tells us to not add the
        piece to the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we need to repeat a process multiple times. Say we’ve run out
        of wood and need to chop more. We have one large piece of wood and we
        want to chop it into 4 pieces. We need to repeat the action of splitting
        it more than once to have 4 pieces. If we were to code this we would use
        a control statement called a loop. The computer will execute this line
        of code as many time as it’s told before moving onto the next line of
        code. This piece of code shows how we can code a "for" loop.
      </p>
      <img src="images/control-flow-3.png" />
      <p>
        First we let the computer know how many "piecesOfWood" we have (1), then
        we tell it to repeat "split wood again" until "piecesOfWood" = 4. the
        "++" will add "1" to our "pieceOfWood" count each time the action "split
        wood again" is executed. Once we have 4 pieces the computer will move
        onto the next bit of code.

      <h3>What is the DOM and how do we interact with it?</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM or Document Object Model can be viewed as a kind of tool that
        allows a browser to interact with the pages that make up the website.<br /><br />
        Sometimes when we visit websites we want information to update/change as
        a response to different tasks we perform whilst navigating them. For
        example when we add an item to our cart we want that little number
        representing how many items are in our cart to increase by 1. For this
        to happen the website needs to be dynamic. The DOM is responsible for
        this dynamic response.<br /><br />
        The DOM creates a version of the webpage that the browser can talk to
        and manipulate if it needs to using JavaScript, we call this the
        “document”. This document is divided into what we call “objects”.<br /><br />
        Each object represents all the different elements on our page such as
        heading, paragraphs and buttons (or our cart). The DOM has tools that
        can change and manipulate objects. In response to triggers from the user
        such as button clicks the DOM can target and update objects by changing
        their properties or cause action by calling methods. Using the DOM we
        are able to create exciting, dynamic websites that customize our user
        experience.

      <h3>What's the difference between "arrays" and "objects"?</h3>
      <p>
        Both arrays and objects can be used for storing and retrieving data.
        However, the key difference is HOW they store and retrieve this data.<br /><br />Arrays
        store an ordered collection of items/data. Say we have a box of 5
        spanners. The array in this case is represented as the box, and the
        spanners are the collection of items the array holds. Each spanner has a
        different length and has its own slot within the box numbered 0-4 (slot
        1 = 0, slot 2 = 1, … slot 5 = 4). It is important to note that an array
        organizes the items it contains by index values starting from 0. The
        slots within the box represent the index values of items stored in an
        array, each item having its own unique index value. If I was to ask
        someone to retrieve a spanner for me I would have to tell them the
        number of the slot that the spanner is in for them to be able to
        retrieve the right one. The same goes for arrays. To retrieve an item
        from an array we need to specify the index value of the item we are
        trying to access. Take a look at the code below.
      </p>
      <img src="images/arrays.png" />
      <p>
        See how in order to retrieve Spanner2 within the array we need use the
        index number '1' rather than 2 even though it's the second item in the
        list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects on the other hand are an unordered collection of items/values.
        Let’s use one of our spanners. A spanner in this case is representing an
        object. It has some information on it telling us what type and size it
        is. These two attributes are represented by the “keys” type and size.
        Each “key” holds a corresponding value relating to the object. If I
        asked someone to find me a 10mm wrench spanner they would need to check
        the key “size” for “10mm” and the key “type” for “wrench”. The same goes
        for objects in JavaScript, to retrieve a specific value from an object
        we need to specify the key of the value that we are retrieving. Check
        out the code below.

      <h3>Functions - What are they and why are they helpful?</h3>
      <p>
        Functions are like little reuseable packages of code that perform some
        sort of procedure. Essentially there’s two parts to a function: Defining
        it and calling it.<br /><br />
        First we need to define the function. Say there’s a task we want to
        complete over and over and requires writing numerous lines of code every
        time we want to action it. Instead of typing out each line of code every
        time we want to complete the task we can assign the block of code to a
        function name. The function name now represents our wee (or large) block
        of code.<br /><br />
        Now we can call the function. Everytime we want to action the task we
        defined in our function, instead of typing it out again, we just use the
        function name. By doing this we save time and it also makes our
        JavaScript code more readable, organized and reusable. Another great
        benefit of this is if we want to change any part of the task being
        executed we only have to make changes once as we only need to update the
        section where we defined the function.
