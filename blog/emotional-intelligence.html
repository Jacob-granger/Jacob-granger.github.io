      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence (EQ) is our ability to be aware of our own and
        others emotional state. Our thoughts and actions are under constant
        influence from emotions connected to our past, present, and future, it’s
        a part of being human. They are a force to be reckoned with and it can
        be hard finding a balance between letting our emotions control our lives
        and shutting them out completely. Good EQ is dependent on our ability to
        perceive, reason, understand, and manage emotions so they can guide our
        thoughts and actions to connect better with ourselves and others.

      <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        EQ is dependent on self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness,
        and relationship management. EQ isn’t static, it can change overtime
        through practice and learning from experiences. IQ is more of a fixed
        metric and is hard to improve. It is measured through our capability in
        intellectual pursuits such as logical reasoning, word comprehension, and
        math skills.<br /><br />
        In short EQ (Emotional Quotient) indicates a person’s ability to
        understand the emotions of themselves and others. On the other hand IQ
        (Intelligence Quotient) indicates a person’s intelligence level. It
        represents someone's ability to use information and logic to solve
        problems and understand or communicate complex ideas.

      <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        Having a high level of emotional intelligence allows us to empathize
        with others, communicate effectively, and be both self and socially
        aware. Naturally, being good at these skills will help us to build good
        relationships, improve leadership, reduce stress (personally and in team
        environments) and manage conflict. Ultimately improving and working on
        EQ can bring us happiness through job satisfaction, meaningful
        relationships and personal achievement to name a few.<br /><br />
