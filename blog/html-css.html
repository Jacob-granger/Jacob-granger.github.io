        INLINE VS INLINE BLOCK, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Learning the basics of becoming a great web developer can be tricky and
        confusing. A simple concept that’s important to grasp is the display
        properties of block, inline, and inline-block elements. Having a solid
        understanding of this will assist you tremendously in your journey to
        creating beautiful layouts in no time. So without further ado, let's
        dive into it!
      </p>
      <h3>DISPLAY: BLOCK</h3>
      <p>
        To begin our understanding let’s first look at what “block” means.
        Consider elements (such as div) as boxes. Each box contains the content
        we want to display and will use horizontal and vertical space on a
        screen to display the content.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a box’s display poperty is “block” we can set both its height and
        width values. The vertical space it will use equals its height. Other
        boxes can use the vertical space above or below that it doesn't need.
        However, horizontally it will reserve 100% of the available screen space
        for itself. Even if its width is less than the available space. It will
        not share any screen space to its left or to its right. Below the green
        highlighted lines of code show which class properties are effecting the
        size of each box.

      <h3>DISPLAY: INLINE</h3>
      <p>
        If a box display property is “inline” we can no longer set its height
        and width values. The vertical and horizontal space it will use will be
        the minimum amount of space required to display the content it contains.
        Other boxes are able to use the available horizontal and vertical space
        surrounding the “inline” box. See below the red highlighted lines of
        code. These properties no longer have an effect on the display of the
        box. It is just the content properties that have an effect, in this case
        “font-size”.
      </p>

      <h3>DISPLAY: INLINE-BLOCK</h3>
      <p>
        Inline-block. When a box display property is “inline-block” it will have
        all the display attributes of an Inline box however we can now set its
        size and width values as well. The vertical and horizontal space it will
        use is dependent on its height and width. However, now (just like an
        inline box) it will share available space horizontally and vertically.
        We can see that from the code below that the width and height properties
        are now defining the space each box uses.
