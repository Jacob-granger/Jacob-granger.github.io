        INLINE VS INLINE BLOCK, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Learning the basics of becoming a great web developer can be tricky and
        confusing. A simple concept that’s important to grasp is the display
        properties of block, inline, and inline-block elements. Having a solid
        understanding of this will assist you tremendously in your journey to
        creating beautiful layouts in no time. So without further ado, let's
        dive into it!
      </p>
      <h3>DISPLAY: BLOCK</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        First let’s describe our elements such as paragraphs and headings as
        boxes. Our first type of box has a display type “Block”. A Block box is
        greedy and takes up an entire line on our screen and doesn't share it
        with other boxes. If other boxes want to join they have to find space
        either above or below a “block” box. They will only stack on top of each
        other, not beside each other. How much space a block box takes up can be
        defined by its dimension, margin, and padding properties.
